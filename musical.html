                        <p>
                            I gave up on art and moved to music because it looked cool. I convinced my dad to buy me an electric piano
                            and joined the music club. Honestly, it was really fun! I learned lots of songs I wanted but often got frustrated
                            when they were hard to play.
                        </p>

                            <strong>Rating:</strong> 8/10. Loved learning songs, but it was very time-consuming since I decided to play by ear 
                            instead of learning to read sheet music.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This was one of my most humbling hobbies. For some reason, during kindergarten, I felt super motivated to write 
                            songs and even showed them to my mom (which I hope she has forgotten!). The era ended abruptly after a history class 
                            assignment where we had to creatively explain the Mexican Revolution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My friends and I decided to make an album because we thought we were rockstars. We wrote one main song, but the 
                            performance was a disaster: the track stopped working, and we had to sing it a capella, looking like religious ladies 
                            in church. The lyrics were kind of good, but the execution was unforgettable—for all the wrong reasons.
                        </p>

                            <strong>Rating:</strong> 2/10. It wasn’t completely bad because I worked with friends, but the experience was rough!
